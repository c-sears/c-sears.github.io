                <p class="bio-body">Robert Bryson Hall is an American rapper, singer, songwriter and music producer better known by his stage name Logic. Coming from a broken family, he has had unfortunate experiences as a child. Growing up, he witnessed his brothers selling drugs, his father buying those drugs, his alcoholic mother and sisters getting beaten up by men. However, even at that age, he tried to see the positivity of the situation and made those experiences a lesson as to what not to do with his own life. To escape his abusive mother, he left home when he was 17 years old and took up two odd jobs. He found relief through music, and started to express himself with his raps. He doesn't shy away from writing about his experiences in his songs, which makes most of his songs extremely personal, but he never glorifies his tumultuous upbringing. He has been heavily influenced by Frank Sinatra's vocal jazz, even though he is more into hip-hop music. Quentin Tarantino has been another big influence on him. He got recognition through his mixtapes, 'Young, Broke & Infamous' and the 'Young Sinatra' trilogy. Both his studio albums, 'Under Pressure' and 'The Incredible True Story', have received critical and commercial success.</p>

                        <p>Bobby Tarantino is the fifth mixtape by American rapper Logic. It was released on July 1, 2016, by Visionary Music Group and Def Jam Recordings. It was released to various digital platforms without prior announcement. Bobby Tarantino serves as Logic's first mixtape since Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever. The mixtape and its production was handled primarily by Logic and 6ix, with the duo focusing on a similar style to that of their previous independent projects, working on reinstating previous elements considered missing from Logic's commercial releases. The mixtape was preceded by the release of "Flexicution" and "Wrist", released ten days apart from one another.

                                Bobby Tarantino received generally positive reviews from critics, with particular attention being drawn to its production and varied nature, as well as Logic's newly found braggadocio. Criticism was directed at basic lyricism and a lack of depth that was associated with Logic's preceding releases. It was labeled the "perfect fill in for his junior album".</p>

                        <p>Maryland rapper Logic’s new album, Everybody, is a strangely faithful adaptation of the short story with an emphasis on the endless cycle of reincarnations that’d eventually—hypothetically—cause everyone to be different incarnations of the same person. He weaves his own struggles with race and religion into a complex, panoramic view of humanity, seeking a unified theory of equality, not just for his mortal coil but for the cosmos. If this seems convoluted that’s because it is: Weir’s story was meant as a fanciful (albeit thoughtful) work of fiction, not an intersectional parable. “Every time you victimized someone you were victimizing yourself,” the short story goes. “Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself.” This is Everybody’s central conceit: We are all the same, and every misdeed hurts the human race equally. Logic gets even more literal in the subtext, drawing parallels between this life force balance and his mixed-race heritage. Herein, an existential crisis unfolds.</p>

                    <div class="slide-bottom-middle album-desc">
                        <p>Under Pressure is the debut studio album by American rapper Logic. It was released on October 21, 2014, by Visionary Music Group and Def Jam Recordings. Development and composition of the album began in 2013, with recording taking place during a two-week span at the beginning of 2014. The album's production was primarily handled by No I.D., with smaller contributions from a variety of record producers, including 6ix, DJ Dahi, DJ Khalil, S1, Jake One and Dun Deal. The standard edition of the album contained no guest appearances, with Big Sean and Childish Gambino being featured on tracks "Alright" and "Driving Ms. Daisy", respectively, on the album's deluxe edition.

                                Logic sought to create an album that would stand out as "beautiful, musical and melodic" while also including "raw lyricism". In order to establish his desired sound, his lyricism is heavily introspective, analyzing himself by exploring his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame, his family, feelings of self-consciousness, success, and his struggles with addiction. His goal was to provide an autobiography which explicitly detailed the scenarios and experiences that impacted him during his rise in the music industry. The album was supported by two singles: "Under Pressure" and "Buried Alive", each focusing on Logic's struggles both due to and aside from his musical career.</p>
